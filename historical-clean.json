Additionally, each branded portal instance will require approximately one week to create an independent theme (we need design to be provided for each brand).The document currently lists five different portals (need to take into accout that since etc. is mentioned there may be more). Assuming we create one brand panel initially, there would be four remaining, which would add roughly another four weeks of work to create the additional branded portals.Therefore, the overall estimate for what is currently documented is approximately 2 to 2.5 months for one engineer.Given my current workload, I should be able to start working on it at the end of June/beginning of July, but that depends on the priorities of other projects (Expert Networks, M3MI)cc  "

                                            "text":  "Hi  ,Point 1  - ScopeThe original request is to display the latest message to the user; however, it isn?t functional because the system only allows messages to be added when a transaction status changes (e.g., from ?Processing\u0027 to \u0027Complete?). Once we batch payments, if a batch remains in the ?Processing? state, we can?t post interim updates; only when we fail or complete the batch. To meet the requirement of displaying the latest and most relevant note without changing payment logic, we should dissociate messaging from status changes: allow ?internal/external notes? to be added at any time and surface the most recent external note to the user.I understand this might seem like an extension of the original request, but since all of this is about enhancing the UI and UX, can we allow those two updates, following the ?Transaction Status Update? approach you recommend? Point 2 - ?Transaction Status Update?Yes, this could work, as adding the ?Transaction Status Update? will meet the objective.Point 3 - Member notesFor now, we can only offer the notes on corrections and payments, as we have more centralised controls and an established process. I understand what you meant by displaying only the latest note. The issue with that is, for example, sometimes participants request multiple payments through different methods, and payments may fail while another transaction is being processed. So if we have to provide updates on those two transactions, one will be missed.For now, we can expose notes only for corrections and payments, where we have centralised controls and an established process.On showing ?only the latest note?: that?s risky at the member level. Participants often have multiple concurrent payment requests via different methods; one may fail while another is still processing. If we surface a single latest note, updates for the other transaction can be hidden.Would it work if we display the latest external note for each ?active? transaction, in addition to the last payment, for 30 days (only the previous payment)?Point 4 - ?History?Using ?History? as the label is fine, but please don?t render it as plain text; users may miss that it?s a clickable item. Use the notes icon + ?History? as a clickable button in the last column to match the Wallet theme and improve discoverability.Regards, Alexis"

What name do you suggest??Display External Notes and Notes? internal process update?Here is the feedback for the two outstanding questions. Point 1 - ScopeThe problem is that the current Notes are not providing enough insights during the payment cycle; therefore, they have become inadequate, as participants are constantly contacting us for updates during the processing phase, and it is time-consuming to prepare external dotmailer campaigns to send communications to participants. The internal update interface is necessary due to the multi-language updates, allowing for updates to be provided as quickly as possible.I understand that you are looking for two new features:Add the same internal note and / or member note to all payments of the batch through the form:Yes. Currently, we can update notes either through the Batch screen or file upload; there is no distinction between these methods. The only rule is that we must ?update the transaction status? to trigger an update in the system notes. Additionally, the issue here is that the batch upload doesn?t distinguish between record languages, and payment requests are grouped by method and currency. To simplify the process, leaving the option of batch updates to top-level updates, for example, when the whole batch belongs to a single country, which implicitly covers a single language, would be beneficial. However, when dealing with multiple countries/languages, we must use the file upload feature. A few things to consider:I?m somewhat concerned that uploading the same file multiple times could result in duplicate notes.To avoid this, I think we can have two-tier system updates:Tier 1 ?Stage? ? Transaction Stage updates happen when we update the transaction: Processing, complete, or failedTier 2 ?Status? ? Transaction Status Update: The ?Transaction Status Update? will trigger inter-transaction-stage updates. To avoid adding duplicate notes, we can leave the record as a ?Processing? status, which will skip the record.Under this approach, if we use ?Transaction Status Update? to trigger an inter-stage update (?Processing? to ?Complete?/? Failed?), to control the duplication of messages or skip a record, we can leave it as ?Processing?; otherwise, Tier 2 updates are logged when we use a ?Transaction Status Update? option. Furthermore, if we change the record from ?Processing? to ?Failed? or ?Complete?, this will be a Tier 1 update, which is already accepting messages for each update. However, we still need the file upload to handle the multilingual batches.Should adding notes be allowed for any payment status (processing, failed, completed)?Only during the ?processing? stage, as 80% of the updates will occur during this phase. Otherwise, any update on ?complete and failed? will be carried out as a tier 1 ?Transaction-stage update? following the options of batch/file updates (due to the multilingual transactions).Should we allow adding an internal note without a member note? In that case, it would appear as ?Transaction Status Update? in the history, but no message would be provided.No, Member notes must always be there, because this is a UI improvement. For internal notes, we have various controls and processes in place.Point 3 - Member notesDisplay the latest external note for all ?active? manual corrections and payments. ?Active? means the transaction status is not Failed or Completed. Correct. The ?Processing? stage should be the main active status. The issue with ?Manual Payments? is that we don?t have a processing stage; it transitions directly from ?waiting to process? to ?complete or failed?, without requiring inter-stage updates. We don\u0027t need inter-stage updates because we initiate the process when we are certain that all the necessary information is correct to process the payment. Manual correction statuses range from ?nothing to ?complete? (as they are used for adjustments) and will follow the updates explained below under ?Tier 1?. However, these updates can only be applied through file upload, as we cannot batch them and do not require an inter-stage update.Display external notes for all payments as long as the notes are no older than 30 days. Or should this only apply to the latest payment with notes?The issue we have is that in some markets, we allow multiple requests at the same time, so the conditions should be according to the transaction?s stage as follows:Processing = Active + ?Transaction Status Update? (all transaction ?Tier 2? updates will happen at this stage), always on display.Complete = Inactive + the latest message (Tier 1) for 30 days OR until a new payment request is submitted, according to the latest transaction update (Tier 2 messages won?t apply under this phase).Failed = Inactive + the latest message (Tier 1) until a new payment request is submitted (Tier 2 messages won?t apply under this phase).Please let me know if you have more questions.Thanks Alexis"

The Demo went well. 2 very minor bugs were displayed during the presentation and have already been addressed. 2 concerns came up regarding: the order of discounts that needs to be applied (Beth, Alex and Mayu are having conversations around this topic to come to a decision) and if PMs will remember to recalculate the discount (if the project scope changes after being applied) - Jason already has implemented a fix for this one. It was originally asked to add more alerts and warnings to the system to prevent this, so having Jason finding a way around that will leave the process less cluttered.UAT has begun. I?ve heard from a few people regarding connection issues and inviting more testers in. The tentative due date is EOD   I will follow up then and see if more time is needed.

The IT team was made aware of the problem on May 20th, unfortunately we still do not have a solution. Likely a new ISP would be needed.While onboarding M3GR and sending their higher quality lists alongside M3MI lists would help to mitigate point 1. We can?t really onboard M3GR because of point 2.

Stakeholders were informed that the project is wrapping up by the end of August and that they need to submit any changes before then.Due to continued deliverability volatility, we held a review meeting with Neil and Stuart and agreed to add four more servers into the mix. The sponsor (Neil) is now fully aware of the deliverability challenges and that the ad hoc work related to improving deliverability may continue well after the project closes.Overall, we are still optimistic that we can build enough reputation to send the required volumes for M3GR. For M3MI, we are still waiting for engagement numbers to be provided so we can plan the required volume, as the initial request to send over 200K cold emails within a few days is not feasible due to ESP industry constraints outside our control. Nevertheless, due to higher deliverability on bulk email compared to the previous vendor, we hope the required engagement (responses and completes) can be achieved with a smaller sample, which we will be able to deliver within a few months.Additionally, a new report on domain deliverability was created this week and is available in the MR System here."

Adam is currently working on Divisional KPI project so will need to discuss timeline due to time availability.  Here is a breakdown of what is coming.Objective: Add accruals as a new measure to revenue reporting in Power BI.Use Case: Accruals (including cross-divisional) from the previous month should be:Displayed as a new line in the reports.Deducted from future months? unaccrued revenue.Reports Impacted:Revenue Projection ReportGlobal Team Revenue ReportProfit ReportCurrent StatusAccrual functionality is now live in the MR system.Randy is building a master accrual log, to be updated monthly and serve as the primary data source for this integration.Technical Considerations1. ETL / Data Model ImpactThe request is currently ?jumping past? ETL and modeling layers.We need to define how accruals reshape the existing revenue modeling before implementing front-end changes.2. Effective Date HandlingAccruals will require modifying the effective date of certain revenue records to reflect month of accrual.This is critical for FX conversion, which is driven by effective date.Clarification is needed on whether only portions of a line will be re-dated or full lines.3. Revenue Definition AdjustmentsWe currently define multiple revenue types:TypeDescriptionQuoted RevenueProjected revenue based on quoted targetsExpected RevenueCurrently used in most reports; dynamically reflects project stageInvoiced RevenueRevenue from approved invoicesActual RevenueBooked finance revenueDescoped RevenueRemoved from scope; may blend with actualsAccrued Revenue ? NewRevenue manually recorded to reflect earned revenue ahead of invoicing; used for improving month-end reporting accuracyWe need to define:A new measure: \"Accrued Revenue\".Logic for how \"Accrued Revenue\" interacts with \"Expected Revenue\" and \"Actual Revenue\".Whether Expected Revenue should decrease in future months when accruals are recorded.Next Steps \u0026 QuestionsModeling ? Confirm how accruals will update or supplement revenue lines in the data warehouse.Effective Date ? Will it shift or create new rows for partial revenue lines?Definitions ? Finalize language for \"Accrued Revenue\" and its relationship to existing KPIs.ETL Changes ? Plan for extracting and transforming the accrual log Randy is building.Power BI Changes ? Once the above is settled, implement changes in model and reports."
